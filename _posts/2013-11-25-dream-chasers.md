There is 3 types of niggas in life. Niggas that make it happen, niggas that watch it happen, and niggas that dunno wtf is going on. Choose one.

If you want to succeed, your fate lies in your hands. Failure is ultimately a choice many of us make, but the power is yours to circumvent this. Get a plan in order and do it fucking now. Sitting around all day will not increase your revenue or build your resume, the *only* way to seize the outcome you desire is by **doing**. Today was a record day for the Nikkei, simply put get on board or get left behind.

Nobody is going to hold your hand through the challenges you face. Future you will be patting your back, and nothing else matters.
